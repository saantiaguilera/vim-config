## My Vim Configuration

This is just my vim config and some others (like the modified color I use). If you like it feel free to use it :)

Installing: `cd ~ && git clone git@github.com:saantiaguilera/vim-config.git .vim`

The reason I have created this repo is because I changed my computer before grabbing this configs and I lost them. Hence, this wont happen again.

This is simply a fork of [vim-tide](https://github.com/bilibili/vim-vide) with some small changes applied
