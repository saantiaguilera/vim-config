## My Vim Configuration

This is just my `.vimrc` file and some others (like the modified colour I use). If you like it feel free to use it :)

## Requirements

- Mustang color. Simply copy it inside `~/.vim/colors/mustang.vim`
- AG. Install it with `brew install the_silver_searcher`
- This `.vimrc` :)
