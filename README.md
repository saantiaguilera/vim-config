## My Vim Configuration

This is just my `.vimrc` file and some others (like the modified colour I use). If you like it feel free to use it :)

The reason I have created this repo is because I changed my computer before grabbing this file and I lost it. Hence, this wont happen again.

## Requirements

- Mustang color. Simply copy it inside `~/.vim/colors/mustang.vim`
- AG. Install it with `brew install the_silver_searcher`
- This `.vimrc` :)

## How does it look like?

Really minimalistic, this is a screenshot taken from a java file
